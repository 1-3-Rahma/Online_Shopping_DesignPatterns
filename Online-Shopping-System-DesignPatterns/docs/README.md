# ShopSmart (Modern Swing UI + Design Patterns)

Run `com.shopping.Main`.

## V3 fixes requested
- Dark mode toggle no longer zooms (font scaling applied once).
- Product table: Details column is wider + horizontal scroll works.
- Cart bottom: spacing so Total label does not overlap buttons.
- Admin: Category/Type is editable (dynamic) — not static anymore.
- Customer: Category filter updates dynamically from products list.

Patterns remain within your course list:
- Search/Filter: Composite + Factory Method
- Undo/Redo: Command
- Theme toggle: Bridge
